# COSC 302 Lab Assignments
---
This is a collections of assignments done during the fall semester of 2017 at The University of Tennessee - Knoxville.  The direct link to all assignments of the course is located [here.](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs302/labs.html)  The Lab folder numbers are offset by -1 due to the way I structured the assignments.

I had a blast partcipating in this course. My strongest project is probably my Network Flow (Lab A.) My weakest is probably Lab 4(Superball.) 

Thank  you for taking a look at my work!
